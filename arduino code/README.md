# Arduino Code
In this folder you have the Arduino code for compiling with [Arduino IDE 1.8.3](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.3-windows.zip) (because at the time it was the latest release, attached here is respective library dependencies, I assume it works fine with [last 1.8](https://downloads.arduino.cc/arduino-1.8.19-windows.exe)) of 3 main board: Arduino1 with 3 Modules(IP 192.168.1.101), Arduino2 with 3 Modules(IP 192.168.1.102), and Arduino 3 with 2 Modules(IP 192.168.1.103) and they connect to the MQTT server 192.168.1.100.
There are sketch named mqtt_1 to mqtt_4 that was created accordingly for compiling the main board with 1 to 4 modules respectivly.
You can modify accordingly with your setup needs.
